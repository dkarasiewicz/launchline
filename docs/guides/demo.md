# Demo Guide

This guide walks through a short, high-impact Launchline demo focused on execution clarity.

## Core message

Launchline surfaces real execution context without surveillance:

- Blockers before they burn a sprint
- Hidden impact that dashboards miss
- Actionable next steps, not vanity metrics

## Demo flow (5 minutes)

### 1) Connect Linear (30s)

- Go to **Inbox -> Settings**
- Connect Linear
- Watch inbox items populate

**Talk track**: "Connect a workspace and Linea immediately finds what needs attention."

### 2) Show the Execution Inbox (60s)

Highlight a few items:

- Blockers
- Stalled work
- Unassigned high-priority tickets

**Talk track**: "This is not a dashboard. It is a list of decisions you should make today."

### 3) Ask for sprint status (45s)

Use the suggestion prompt:

> "How's the sprint going? Any blockers I should know about?"

Point out:

- Completion status
- Specific blockers with IDs
- Suggested next actions

### 4) Show hidden impact (60s)

Ask:

> "I noticed Sarah hasn't closed many tickets recently. What's she actually been working on?"

**Talk track**: "Launchline explains invisible work and protects deep contributors from bad metrics."

### 5) Generate a project update (60s)

Ask:

> "Generate a project update for stakeholders."

Show the structured summary and suggested distribution format.

### 6) Optional: Slack follow-through (30s)

If Slack is connected:

- Send a summary into a channel
- Mention that Linea can also be used from Slack directly

## What to prepare

- Linear workspace with active issues
- At least 2-3 team members
- Some issues in "In Progress"
- At least one stalled ticket (7+ days without update)
- Optional: Slack workspace connected

## Backup prompts

- "What are the active blockers right now?"
- "Who needs help this week?"
- "Where is priority drifting?"
- "Summarize recent decisions for me"
