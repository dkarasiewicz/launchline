# Launchline Product Overview

## Mission

Launchline helps teams see what's *actually* happening - not what fits in spreadsheets.

We believe teams should organize around people's strengths, not force people into arbitrary processes. Transparency without micromanagement. Impact without fake KPIs.

## The Problem

Most teams waste resources not because people aren't working, but because **context is invisible**:

- A developer who "closes fewer tickets" might be preventing production fires
- Someone who writes less code might be unlocking others through great design  
- A PM who doesn't "ship features" might be keeping the team aligned

Traditional tracking tools either micromanage (hours, commits, messages) or miss the real story (tickets closed). One-size-fits-all KPIs punish different working styles.

## The Solution

Launchline is an **AI-augmented execution platform** that:

1. **Surfaces hidden impact** - code reviews, mentoring, firefighting, unblocking others
2. **Respects context** - understands *why* work is slow, not just *that* it is
3. **Embraces different styles** - recognizes value that doesn't show up in Jira
4. **Increases transparency** - gives managers clarity without surveillance
5. **Keeps it fair** - respects people who do their job, highlights those who go beyond

## Target Users

### Primary: Product Managers

PMs drowning in tools, Slack threads, and context switching. Need a single place to:
- See what's actually blocking progress
- Identify priority drift before it derails timelines
- Make decisions with full context
- Keep stakeholders informed

### Secondary: Engineering Leads

Tech leads who need to understand team health without micromanaging

### Future: Founders / CTOs

Executives who need strategic visibility without getting lost in details
